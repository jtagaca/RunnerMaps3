## About
This is the prototype for the upcoming project that will address the most pressing issue at CSUB: navigation, and the solution is RunnerMaps.

## Context
This is a project for a course at my university; I created it in three weeks, so the user interface isn't great, but the functionality is fantastic. Furthermore, it demonstrates how navigation problems can be solved at CSUB, making it a prototype.
This is a full-stack project with a PHP backend and a React front end. The database is hosted on a CSUB server and usesÂ MySQL.

## Challenges 
The lack of indoor navigation solutions at CSUB and my limited time to develop this project were both challenges.
One of the most challenging aspects of navigation is indoor navigation because the most common solution involves hardware that monitors a device's geolocation.
However, due to the lack of funding for this project, there is no hardware to monitor the device's geolocation.
As a result, this project necessitates creativity and critical thinking to solve a problem from a fresh perspective.
