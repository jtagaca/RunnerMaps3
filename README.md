## About
This is the prototype for the upcmoming project to solve the biggest issue at CSUB; navigation and this solution is RunnerMaps.

## Context
This is a project for a course at my university, this was made in 3 weeks and thus the UI is not looking to good, however the functionality is good as well as shows the idea on how navigation can be solved at CSUB, This is a fullstack project with the backend written in PHP and React for the front end, A few challenges that I saw was the limited time I had to develop this as well as ways to solve indoor navigation at csub, indoor navigation is one of the most challenging aspects of navigation since the most traditional way of solving this is to have hardware that would monitor the geo location of a device however as you can see there is no funding for this project and thus this project requires innovation as well as critical thinking to solve a problem in a different perspective.
